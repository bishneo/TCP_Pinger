# TCP_Pinger
Java Socket Programming implementation  The goal of this assignment is to implement a TCP client and server. You can use Java. Your TCP client/server will communicate over the network and exchange data. You can use localhost to test your work.  The server will start in passive mode listening for a transmission from the client. The client will then start and contact the server (on a given IP address and port number). The client will pass the server a string (eg: “network”) up to 80 characters in length.  On receiving a string from a client, the server should: 1) reverse all the characters, and 2) reverse the capitalization of the strings (“network” would now become “KROWTEN”).   The server should then send the string back to the client. The client will display the received string and exit.    Example Starting the server:   Assume that you started a server on machine 128.111.49.44, listening to port number 32000. The syntax should look something the following (not exactly):   csil-machine1> server 32000 &lt;enter>   Starting the client:   csil-machine2> client 128.111.49.44 32000 &lt;enter>    Enter text: This is my text to be changed by the SERVER &lt;enter>  Response from server: revres EHT YB DEGNAHC EB OT TXET YM SI SIHt csil-machine2>   At this point (after receiving one line to be reversed), the server and client should both exit.
